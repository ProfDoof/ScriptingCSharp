<p>The Fibonacci numbers are a well-known mathematical sequence.
The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, then each following number is the 
sum of the preceding two numbers, so the sequence looks like: <br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
</p>

<p>Write a function <b>int fib(int n)</b> that calculates and returns the n<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number.<br>
We will treat 0 as the 0<sup>th</sup> number and 1 as the 1<sup>st</sup> number.<br>
Besides these base cases, the n<sup>th</sup> number is the sum of the n-1 and n-2 numbers in the sequence.</p>

<p>Create a main function that prompts the user to enter a number, then 
uses the <b>fib</b> function to find the value at that place in the Fibonacci sequence
and prints this value to the screen.</p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below (user input shown in red):</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Which place in the sequence do you want to calculate? <span class=input>0</span>

Fibonacci(0) is 0
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Which place in the sequence do you want to calculate? <span class=input>7</span>

Fibonacci(7) is 13
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
Which place in the sequence do you want to calculate? <span class=input>4</span>

Fibonacci(4) is 3
</pre>
