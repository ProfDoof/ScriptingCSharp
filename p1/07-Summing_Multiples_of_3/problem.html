<p>Write a program that, given an integer <u>number</u>, 
calculates and prints the sum of all positive multiples of 3 between zero and <u>number</u>
(including <u>number</u> if it is a multiple of 3).</p>

<p>You must write and use a recursive function <b>sum3s</b> that accepts <i>one integer parameter</i>
and returns the sum of the positive multiples of 3 between zero and that value.
Your function should work for any integer.
</p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>10</span>

The sum is 18.
</pre>

<p>In the first example (above): the positive multiples of 3 between 0..10 are {3,6,9}, 
which sum to 18.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>12</span>

The sum is 30.
</pre>

<p>In the second examle (above): the positive multiples are {3,6,9,12}, 
which sum to 30.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>4</span>

The sum is 3.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter number: <span class=input>1</span>

The sum is 0.
</pre>
