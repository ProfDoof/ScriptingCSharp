<p> You have already created a program to calculate annual interest from a starting balance and interest rate.
Now create a function <b>float update_balance(float balance, float rate)</b> 
that calculates the interest earned in one year and returns the updated balance (with interest added).
Use the function to calculate and display the ending balance on a <i>three</i>-year savings account.</p>

<p>Just as before, simple annual interest is computed by multiplying the starting balance times the rate. 
The ending balance after each year is the starting balance plus the interest. </p>

<p>Prompt the user to input the starting balance and interest rate (as <b>float</b>s),
then use the function to calculate and display the ending balance after three years. 
Since these are monetary values, always display the value with exactly two decimal places.
Sample runs are shown below.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates the ending balance on a three-year savings account.

Starting balance? <span class=input>5000</span>
Interest rate? <span class=input>3</span>

Balance after one year: $5150.00
Balance after two years: $5304.50
Balance after three years: $5463.63
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates the ending balance on a three-year savings account.

Starting balance? <span class=input>9500</span>
Interest rate? <span class=input>1.25</span>

Balance after one year: $9618.75
Balance after two years: $9738.98
Balance after three years: $9860.72
</pre>
