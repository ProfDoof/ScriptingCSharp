<p>Write a program that calculates the time neccessary to completely fill an empty pool with water.
We will assume that the pool is rectangular and the depth is uniform.
All input values in this program will be integers.</p>

<p>Prompt the user to enter the pool dimensions - <i>length</i>, <i>width</i>, and <i>depth</i> (unit: feet) - 
as well as the <i>rate</i> at which water can be put into the pool (unit: gallons per minute).
Using these values, calculate and display the time (in minutes) needed to fill the pool 
from completely empty to completely full.</p>

<p>Note: you should calculate the volume of the pool (as cubic feet) and then determine the rate 
(in cubic feet per minute) that water can be put into the pool.
Assume that there are 7.48 gallons in one cubic foot.</p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter pool dimensions
Length: <span class=input>10</span>
Width: <span class=input>8</span>
Depth: <span class=input>7</span>

Water entry rate: <span class=input>14</span>

The pool will fill completely in 299.2 minutes
</pre>

<p>In the first example (above): the pool has a volume of 560 cubic feet, or 4188.8 gallons.
At 14 gallons per minute, it will require 299.2 minutes to fill the pool.
</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter pool dimensions
Length: <span class=input>32</span>
Width: <span class=input>15</span>
Depth: <span class=input>4</span>

Water entry rate: <span class=input>102</span>

The pool will fill completely in 140.8 minutes
</pre>


<pre class=cmd>
Enter pool dimensions
Length: <span class=input>10</span>
Width: <span class=input>10</span>
Depth: <span class=input>10</span>

Water entry rate: <span class=input>748</span>

The pool will fill completely in 10 minutes
</pre>
