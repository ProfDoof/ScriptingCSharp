<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice the edit-save-compile-run-repeat
cycle of programming as well as practicing simple diagnostic skills. </p>

<p>The area of a triangle is one-half the area defined by multiply the length of
its base times its height. </p>

<p>Create a program to compute the area of triangle given its base and height.
Prompt the user for the base and then the height. </p>

<p>Your program should look and function like the examples shown below,
except that here the user input is shown in red and it will look "normal" in your program.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program computes the area of a triangle.

Enter the base of the triangle: <span class=input>5</span>
Enter the height of the triangle: <span class=input>3</span>

The area is 7.5
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program computes the area of a triangle.

Enter the base of the triangle: <span class=input>6.5</span>
Enter the height of the triangle: <span class=input>3</span>

The area is 9.75
</pre>
