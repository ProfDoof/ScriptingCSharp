<p>Imagine a group of common American coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies). 
Write a program that will prompt the user to enter the number
of each type of coin and then calculate and display the total value.
Ensure that the output shows two decimal places, 
even when there are trailing zeroes (<i>e.g.</i>, show "$1.50", not "$1.5").<p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Quarters: <span class=input>1</span>
Dimes: <span class=input>1</span>
Nickels: <span class=input>1</span>
Pennies: <span class=input>1</span>

The total is $0.41
</pre>

<p>In the first example (above): there is one of each type of coin, so the total value is
.25 + .10 + .05 + .01 = $0.41</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Quarters: <span class=input>6</span>
Dimes: <span class=input>2</span>
Nickels: <span class=input>2</span>
Pennies: <span class=input>0</span>

The total is $1.80
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Quarters: <span class=input>3</span>
Dimes: <span class=input>2</span>
Nickels: <span class=input>1</span>
Pennies: <span class=input>4</span>

The total is $1.04
</pre>
