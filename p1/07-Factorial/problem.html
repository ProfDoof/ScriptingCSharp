<p>In mathematics, the <i>factorial</i> of a positive integer is the product of all 
integers 1..n, so n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1.  
Also, as a special case, 0! = 1.
</p>

<p>Write a function <b>int fact(int n)</b> that calculates and returns the factorial of <i>n</i>.
In your function, you may assume that <i>n</i> is non-negative (zero or greater than zero).</p>

<p>Create a main function that prompts the user to enter a number, then 
uses the <b>fact</b> function to calculate the factorial value,
which should then print to the screen.</p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below (user input shown in red):</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates factorials.
Enter an integer: <span class=input>1</span>

1! = 1
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates factorials.
Enter an integer: <span class=input>3</span>

3! = 6
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates factorials.
Enter an integer: <span class=input>4</span>

4! = 24
</pre>
