<p>Write a program to output the number of days occuring in a given month.</p>

<p>Prompt the user to enter the month and year.
The month will be entered as an integer, where 1 is January, 2 is February, ..., 12 is December.
Calculate and output the number of days occuring in that month.
All input and output should occur within the main function.</p>

<p>January, March, May, July, August, October and December 
(months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12) each have 31 days.</p>
<p>April, June, September, and November (months 4, 6, 9, and 11) each have 30 days.</p>
<p>February has 28 days, except in leap years, when it has 29 days.
Leap years occur when the year is divisible by 4 but not 100 (unless it is also divisible by 400).
For example: 1992 was a leap year and 2000 was a leap year, but 1900 was not a leap year.</p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Month: <span class=input>4</span>
Year: <span class=input>2012</span>

4/2012 has 30 days.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Month: <span class=input>3</span>
Year: <span class=input>2012</span>

3/2012 has 31 days.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Month: <span class=input>2</span>
Year: <span class=input>2012</span>

2/2012 has 29 days.
</pre>
