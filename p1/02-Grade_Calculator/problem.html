<p>As a programmer, you should not need to ask your instructor to calculate your grade in a course, because you can easily write a program to perform that calculation for you.  Here is one simple grading structure for a course: one cumulative homework grade, three exam grades, and a final exam grade; the homework and three exam grades will each count equally, the final exam grade will count twice as much as any other grade.</p>

<p>Each input grade value will be an integer, and the result should also be shown as an integer.  If you're not sure how to do this, read about <i>typecasting</i> in the course notes. </p>

<p>Your program should run like the examples shown below.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Homework: <span class=input>88</span>
Exam #1: <span class=input>90</span>
Exam #2: <span class=input>91</span>
Exam #3: <span class=input>85</span>
Final Exam: <span class=input>80</span>

Overall grade: 85
</pre>

<p>
In the first example (above), the overall average can be calculated as:
(88 + 90 + 91 + 85 + 80 + 80)/6 = 85.67, or, as an integer, 85.
The value 80 is added in twice, because the final exam counts double.
</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Homework: <span class=input>75</span>
Exam #1: <span class=input>85</span>
Exam #2: <span class=input>82</span>
Exam #3: <span class=input>79</span>
Final Exam: <span class=input>73</span>

Overall grade: 77
</pre>
