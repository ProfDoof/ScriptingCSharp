<p>Create a program that accepts two dates as input (each consisting of 3 integers)
and identifies which date occurred or will occur earlier.
You may assume that the two dates are not identical.
Sample runs are shown below.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter date #1 (month day year): <span class=input>8 27 2012</span>
Enter date #2 (month day year): <span class=input>12 14 2012</span>

8/27/2012 is earlier.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter date #1 (month day year): <span class=input>5 15 2009</span>
Enter date #2 (month day year): <span class=input>5 14 2009</span>

5/14/2009 is earlier.
</pre>
