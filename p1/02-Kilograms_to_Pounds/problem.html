<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice using data types and various manipulations of data types. </p>

<p>Create a program that converts kilograms into English pounds and ounces. You should prompt the user for kilograms and display the equivalent pounds and ounces. Two example runs are shown below. </p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program converts kilograms to pounds and ounces.
Kilograms: <span class=input>1</span>

1 kilograms is 2 pounds and 3.2 ounces.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program converts kilograms to pounds and ounces.
Kilograms: <span class=input>8.25</span>

8.25 kilograms is 18 pounds and 2.4 ounces.
</pre>

<p>For this problem, assume a kilogram is 2.2 pounds.</p>

<p>The ounces should be rounded to one decimal place when displayed. 
Use <i>setprecision</i> as described in the notes and summarized here:
</p>
<pre class=code>
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
...
cout << fixed << setprecision(1) << ounces;
</pre>
