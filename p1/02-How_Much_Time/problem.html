<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice numeric calculations.

<p>Create a program that accepts as input an integer specifying a number of seconds, 
then calculate and display the equivalent time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
Running your program should look exactly like the sample runs shown below.
Input is shown in red.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program converts seconds into hours, minutes and seconds.
Enter the number of seconds: <span class=input>3600</span>
This corresponds to 1 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program converts seconds into hours, minutes and seconds.
Enter the number of seconds: <span class=input>4000</span>
This corresponds to 1 hours, 6 minutes, and 40 seconds.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program converts seconds into hours, minutes and seconds.
Enter the number of seconds: <span class=input>8412</span>
This corresponds to 2 hours, 20 minutes, and 12 seconds.
</pre>

For this assignment, you may assume that the input will be non-negative (zero or greater).
