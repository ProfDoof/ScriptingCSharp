<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice using IF-ELSE statements.</p>

<p>Create a program that accepts three integers as input and
prints a statement indicating which of the numbers is largest.
Running your program should look exactly like the sample runs shown below.
Input is shown in red.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program identifies the largest of three numbers.

Enter integer: <span class=input>2</span>
Enter integer: <span class=input>4</span>
Enter integer: <span class=input>1</span>

The largest number is 4.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program identifies the largest of three numbers.

Enter integer: <span class=input>7</span>
Enter integer: <span class=input>2</span>
Enter integer: <span class=input>3</span>
