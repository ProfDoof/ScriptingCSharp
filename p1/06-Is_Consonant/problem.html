<!--<p>A predicate function returns a Boolean value.
Often, predicate functions are used to perform some logical operation;
the result can be used as a conditional 
expression in an <b>if</b> statement, for example. </p>

<p>Create a predicate function <b>IsConsonant(char ch)</b>, which returns 
<tt>true</tt> if <tt>ch</tt> is a consonant.  The characters considered 
vowels are: <tt>'a'</tt>, <tt>'e'</tt>, <tt>'i'</tt>, <tt>'o'</tt>, and 
<tt>'u'</tt>.  Your function must handle both upper- and lower-case letters.</p>

<p>Write a main function that accepts one character as input and 
prints a message indicating if that character is or is not a consonant.
</p>-->

<p>
Write a program that accepts one character as input and displays a message
classifying the character as a consonant, vowel, or not a letter.
For this purpose, we will consider 
<tt>'a'</tt>, <tt>'e'</tt>, <tt>'i'</tt>, <tt>'o'</tt>, and <tt>'u'</tt> to be vowels, 
and all other letters to be consonants.
Your program must handle both upper- and lower-case letters.

<pre class=cmd>
Enter character: <span class=input>J</span>

J is a consonant.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter character: <span class=input>o</span>

o is a vowel.
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter character: <span class=input>$</span>

$ is not a letter.
</pre>
