<p>Write a program that reads a floating-point number as input
and then outputs a rounded integer value based on the input.
For example, <b>3.2</b> rounds <i>down</i> to <b>3</b>, while <b>3.7</b> rounds <i>up</i> to <b>4</b>; 
however, <b>-3.2</b> rounds <i>up</i> to </b>-3</b>, while <b>-3.7</b> rounds <i>down</i> to </b>-4</b>.
Your program should look like the sample runs shown below.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter a number: <span class=input>3.2</span>
The rounded number is 3

</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
Enter a number: <span class=input>-3.7</span>
The rounded number is -4

</pre>
