<p>If you have ever parked at an airport, you have probably noticed that airports
typically have complicated rules for determining the cost of parking.
Here is a sample pricing schedule, taken from a real airport.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="0" id="table_inside2">
<tr>
<th>Time</th>
<th> Cost</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">First 30 minutes</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">FREE</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">31 to 60 minutes</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">$2.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Each additional 30 minutes</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">$1.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Up to seven hours</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">$14.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">Thereafter, each hour</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">$1.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">24-hour maximum</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">$21.00</td>

<p>Create a program to input a time (in minutes) that a car has been parked
and then display the cost of parking, according to the pricing scheduled shown above.
</p>

<p>
As noted above, this pricing is from a real airport and the presentation is unclear.
Please note that "each additional 30 minutes" 
means each block of <i>up to</i> 30 minutes, so 65 minutes costs $3 (1 hour + 1 30-minute period).
Each hour after the first seven adds $1 to the cost, 
but the total cost will not exceed $21 for any time within 24 hours.
This program will not be tested with times exceeding 24 hours.
