<p>Write a program that uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD).
For two integers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, gcd(a,b) is:
<ul>
<li>a, if b = 0
<li>gcd(b, a mod b), if b != 0
</ul></p>

<p>Create a recursive function <b>int gcd(int, int)</b> that accecpts two integers
and returns the greatest common divisor between them.
Also, create a main function to accept input and show the results of the function.</p>

<p>Running your program should look like the example below:</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) for two integers.

Enter a number: <span class=input>6</span>
Enter another: <span class=input>8</span>

GCD = 2

</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) for two integers.

Enter a number: <span class=input>24</span>
Enter another: <span class=input>30</span>

GCD = 6

</pre>
