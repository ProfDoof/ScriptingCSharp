<!--Kyle Flanagan - Debugging-->
 
<p>The goal of this exercise is to practice debugging.</p>

<p>Start with the following code. Then, debug the various errors in the code so that the program functions correctly. 
Note that the bug in the code is not a syntax or compile error; the code compiles. The problem lies in the algorithm used.
If you're not sure what the bug is, run the program and try some sample data.</p>
