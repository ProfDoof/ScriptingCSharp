<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice using IF statements.

<p>Create a program that accepts one integer as input and
prints a statement to the screen if that number is zero.
Running your program should look exactly like the sample run shown below.
Input is shown in red.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program checks if the user inputs zero.
Enter an integer: <span class=input>0</span>
Yes, zero was provided as input.
</pre>

If the number is not equal to zero, do not print anything after the input.

<pre class=cmd>
This program checks if the user inputs zero.
Enter an integer: <span class=input>1</span>
</pre>
