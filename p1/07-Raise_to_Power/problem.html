<p>Write a recursive function pow(int,int) -> int.  
This means that the function <i>pow</i> should accept two integers
and return an integer result.</p>

<p> The goal of this exercise is to practice writing recursive functions. </p>

<p> Write a function <b>pow</b> that accepts two integers, <i>base</i> & <i>exp</i>, 
and returns an integer value equal to <i>base</i> to the <i>exp</i> power.
Your function should be recursive and so will not include any loops. </p>

<p> Write a main function to accept input, call the pow function, and display output. 
Your program should run like the example shown below.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates exponential values.
Enter the base:  <span class=input>3</span>
Enter the power: <span class=input>2</span>

3^2 = 9
</pre>

<pre class=cmd>
This program calculates exponential values.
Enter the base:  <span class=input>2</span>
Enter the power: <span class=input>3</span>

2^3 = 8
</pre>

For this assignment, you may assume that the base will be positive and the power will be non-negative (zero or greater).
