Chapter 1

This will prove that, by way of fruits, transitive ignores work perfectly well.

A cherry is a red is a fruit is a food.
An apple is a red is a fruit is a food.
A pear is a green is a fruit is a food.
A spinach is a healthy is a vegetable is a food.
A cucumber is a healthy is a vegetable is a food.
A tomato is a red is a fruit is a food.

When the ignore file chooses to ignore fruit, it will also ignore everything that is a red and a green.  Anything that is a red or green will also be ignored, even though they are not listed in the ignore file.

Spinach will be ignored because it will be directly listed, but this will have no effect on cucumber, healthy, vegetable, or food.

This is paragraph 4 of chapter 2. Everything that WOULD have been paragraphs one
and two were ignored, resulting in them being blank.  Despite their interpretted blankness, the program still recognizes that there's enough to form a paragraph there if the ignore file hasn't intervened. Hence, they exist as empty paragraphs, and this is paragraph 4.
