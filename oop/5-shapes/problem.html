<p>The purpose of this assignment is to continue practice C++ class implementation 
of polymorphic types by expanding the interface and adding new polymorphic classes.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Extend your previous solution for Shapes by adding the new derived class Group. The
group class is exactly what it sounds like&emdash;an object that is not a single shape, but a collection, or 
"group" of shapes. This class should inherit from Shape and provide the same interface.</p> 

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>The Group constructor takes a color, the number of shapes in the Group, and 
an array of Shape pointers to the actual group members. The Group should 
consider that it "owns" the member shapes; meaning it is responsible for 
destroying them. The color of the group determines the color of its individual 
members. See below for an example of typical usage.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Area and perimeter are the sum of the individual member shapes. Inside is 
true if the point is inside any member shape. Moving a shape effectively moves 
all the individual members. An example of the rendering format is shown below.</p>

<p>In addition to the inherited interface, Group should also have functions 
allowing the following code to work.</p>

<pre class=file>
Shape * list[2];
list[0] = new Box(GREEN, 0, 1, 1, 0);
list[1] = new Circle(YELLOW, 2, 2, 2);
Group g(BLUE, 2, list);
	
cout &lt;&lt; "Group area: " &lt;&lt; g.area() &lt;&lt; "\n";
cout &lt;&lt; "Group perimeter: " &lt;&lt; g.perimeter() &lt;&lt; "\n";
	
g.move(1,1);
g.render(cout); cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
g.color(RED);
g.render(cout); cout &lt;&lt; "\n";

cout &lt;&lt; "Count: " &lt;&lt; g.shapes() &lt;&lt; "\n";
g.shape(1)->render(cout); cout &lt;&lt; "\n";

Shape * list2[3];
list2[0] = new Circle(WHITE,5,5,1);
list2[1] = new Box(GREEN,7,1,9,-10);
list2[2] = new RoundBox(BLACK,5,5,8.5,4.5,0.1);
g.shapes(3,list2);
g.render(cout); cout &lt;&lt; "\n";
</pre>

<p>Running the code above should produce the following.</p>

<pre class=cmd>
Group area: 13.5664
Group perimeter: 16.5664
Group(BLUE,2,Box(BLUE,1,2,2,1),Circle(BLUE,3,3,2))
Group(RED,2,Box(RED,1,2,2,1),Circle(RED,3,3,2))
Count: 2
Circle(RED,3,3,2)
Group(RED,3,Circle(WHITE,5,5,1),Box(GREEN,7,1,9,-10),RoundBox(BLACK,5,5,8.5,4.5,0.1))
</pre>
